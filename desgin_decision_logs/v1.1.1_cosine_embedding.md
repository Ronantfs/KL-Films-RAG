-  why cosine simialirty (normalized dot product) over raw dot product 
    - Q: what does norm of n-d semantic vector reprsent? 
-  why we need identicle "vector geometies" but not string pre processing for embeddigns 
- "signal diluation"
- Design decision: How much extra info should go in my vdb? 
- TRADE-OFF: Adding stuff like the director name makes it more flexbile (user could say thinks that might be found in the description for example) but worse matches. Does this matter if it's semantic matching is relative? When does extra info become semantic noise?
