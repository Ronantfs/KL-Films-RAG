here is a sample of my raw data for cinema listngs (baribcan is the cinema, next layer of keys (marty supreme and sentimental value) are the film titles) 

I want to chunk into semantic units and then embeded into my vectorDB for the RAG system I am building. 

For the moment, I want to handle only the following type of query: 

"what films are on at [cinema X] in [date period]"

where [cinema X] and [date period] are english language expressions specifying one or many specific cinemas and a date range respectively

where cinema x is either one or multiple cinemas

----
How can I chunk it in such a way that it works for both a single cinema and multiple cinemas?
