Free-spirited Agnes is ostracised for being the rumoured daughter of a forest witch. She prefers to spend her days embraced by nature\u2019s warmth rather than the chilly atmosphere of her family. But then William, a young teacher and aspiring writer, brings a love into her life like she\u2019s never felt before. Together, they start a family and navigate the growing success of his theatrical career. However, a tragic loss forces the couple to contend with the world-shattering effects of grief.

Health conditions prevent him from holding a driver\u2019s license, so he takes the 240-mile journey by lawnmower.

On the other end of the phone is a six-year-old girl, surrounded by dead bodies. Audible gunfire punctuates her pleas for help, as she hides from encroaching Israeli tanks. From their offices 50 miles away, volunteers fight against red-tape and internal tensions to deliver a rescue ambulance, distress mounting as time marches on. Blending documentary and fiction in service of undeniable truth, audio recordings of Hind\u2019s final hours are woven seamlessly into this recreation of the mission to save her. Oscar-nominated filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania balances hope and helplessness on a tightrope, while honouring both the victims of violence and those who fight to protect them.

Kubrick (who co-wrote the screenplay with Arthur C. Clarke) first visits our prehistoric ape-ancestry past, then leaps millennia (via one of the most mind-blowing jump cuts ever) into colonized space, and ultimately whisks astronaut Bowman (Keir Dullea) into uncharted space, perhaps even into immortality. \u201cOpen the pod bay doors, HAL.\u201d Let an awesome journey unlike any other begin. Please Note: Our 70mm screenings of '2001: A Space Odyssey' follow a partictular presentation procedure; - Overture (3mins / Music) - 1st half of feature (86mins) - * Intermission* (usually 10 for quieter shows, can be 20mins for busier ones) - Entracte (2mins / Music) - 2nd half of feature (54mins) - Exit (5mins / Music) - Total time; approx 170mins (though this is dependent on Intermission length)",

As the couple's dreams of marriage and emigration begin to unravel, Yang's gaze illuminates the precariousness of domestic life and the desperation of Taiwan's globalised modernity.",

That's why he hires D.\n\nD is a Dunpeal, a breed rarer than that of the vampires - after all, he's half of one. When it comes to hunting those with fangs like his own, he's the best in the business. But that doesn't mean he's the only game in town. The Markus Brothers are on the vampire's trail as well, and they're not about to lose. It's a race, not only between the rival Hunters, but for the vampire and his bride-to-be. But it might be more than just a job to D. Is Charlotte really a captive? Or will another Dunpeal be born to this world?",

            "description": "January 29, 2024. Red Crescent volunteers receive an urgent call: a six-year-old girl is trapped in a car under fire in Gaza, begging for rescue. While they try to keep her on the line, they do everything possible to send an ambulance to reach her. Her name was Hind Rajab. Drawing on the audio recording and building a fictional narrative around it, Kaouther Ben Hania (Four Daughters) has made a vital film for our time, awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\u201cI heard an audio recording of Hind Rajab begging for help. By then, her voice had already spread across the Internet. I immediately felt a mix of helplessness, and an overwhelming sadness. (\u2026) I had to drop everything else. I had to make this film. I spoke at length with Hind\u2019s mother, with the real people who were on the other end of that call, those who tried to help her. I listened, I cried, I wrote. Then I wove a story around their testimonies, using the real audio recording of Hind\u2019s voice, and building a single-location film where the violence remains off-screen. That was a deliberate choice. (\u2026)This story is not just about Gaza. It speaks to a universal grief. And I believe that fiction (especially when it draws from verified, painful, real events) is cinema\u2019s most powerful tool. (\u2026) Cinema can preserve a memory. Cinema can resist amnesia.\u201dKaouther Ben Hania",
